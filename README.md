# codeclimate-elixir

This repo is deprecated. It was a bad idea to make a single engine for elixir. I decided to split things. Please check:

 - [Code Climate Credo Engine](https://github.com/fazibear/codeclimate-credo)
 - [Code Climate Dogma Engine](https://github.com/fazibear/codeclimate-dogma)

In the future this engine will check your code using elixir compiler. Stay tuned.
